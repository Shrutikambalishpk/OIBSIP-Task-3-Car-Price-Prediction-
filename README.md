# OIBSIP-Task-3-Car-Price-Prediction-
Implementing car price prediction with Machine Learning using Tkinter involves creating a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to input car features and receive predicted prices. Here are the steps to do that:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Follow the steps mentioned in the previous answer to collect and preprocess the car price dataset.

Model Training: Train your Machine Learning model using the preprocessed dataset.

Create the Tkinter GUI:

a. Import necessary libraries.
When we run the Python script, the Tkinter window will appear, allowing us to input car features and click the "Predict" button. The predicted price will be displayed on the GUI.
